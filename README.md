# Mesa_voter_model
The simplest case of the 2D voter model, implemented with the [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#) agent-based modeling package in Python.

I was messing around with the Mesa package for python, and since I didn't see anyone implement and upload this simple model, I decided to do so.

For anyone new to Mesa, you can install it with pip and then run Server.py
